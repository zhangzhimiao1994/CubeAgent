# Cube Agent (魔方 agent)

Cube Agent is a self-hosted multi-agent operations console. The internal Python package is still named `agent_hub`, but the product-facing UI is Cube Agent / 魔方 agent.

It combines a Web console, Feishu/channel entry points, model pools, workflow and role routing, governed Skills/MCP, scheduled tasks, multimedia generation routing, OpenClaw computer/server operations, Hermes learning, and audit logs.

[中文使用说明](README.zh-CN.md)

## What You Can Do

- Chat with the main agent in Web or supported channels, continue historical conversations, branch from prior context, and attach files. Project-level Vibe Coding is reserved for a future harness/runtime; the current UI does not expose a Vibe Coding button, while backend metadata remains available for future integration. Without that harness, Cube Agent can analyze code and provide modification plans or patch suggestions, but it cannot directly edit a repository, run the resulting tests, review the changes, and debug them end to end.
- Inspect dispatch and discussion runs from the child-agent work seats. Each seat shows name, role, model, status, categorized summaries, and compact cards; click a card to open the detailed drawer. Open drawers stay synced with live run updates, close from the backdrop, and lock background scrolling while active.
- Configure normal chat/tool models separately from multimedia AI models.
- Route image/video/audio generation only to models marked with the matching generation capability.
- Use MiniMax/Hailuo text-to-video through the multimedia executor when a valid deployment and key are configured.
- Generate Word and PowerPoint files through runtime tools: `document.generate_docx` and `presentation.generate_pptx`.
- Upload single-skill or multi-skill `.zip`, `.tar`, `.tar.gz`, and `.tgz` archives for scan, review, approval, use, and deletion. A Skill name keeps one active latest version by default; upload conflicts ask whether to overwrite or keep a separate version for controlled selection.
- Run OpenClaw operations through a system switch, approval mode, allowlisted commands, sessions, and local or remote adapters.
- Create one-time or cron schedules. Chat-detected dated tasks, reminders, and recurring requests become proposals that require user confirmation before creation.
- Review Hermes learning, logs, and audit records. `run.submit` audit records include the user, role, run, conversation, mode, attachments, and a message hash.
- Keep Hermes/Cognitive memory separated by scope. User memory is bound to the current user and must not affect other users. Root memory is shared within the tenant and should only be used for stable project-wide lessons, policies, or environment facts. Runtime injection retrieves only the current user's confirmed memories plus confirmed root memories.

## Quick Install

On a clean supported Linux server:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/zhangzhimiao1994/CubeAgent.git
cd CubeAgent
sudo bash install.sh --mode auto --yes
```

`auto` prefers native mode on supported systemd Linux hosts: Ubuntu 22.04/24.04, Debian 12/13, Rocky Linux 9, and AlmaLinux 9. Docker mode is available as an optional fallback.

If the server does not have `git`:

```bash
tmp="$(mktemp -d /tmp/agent-hub-install.XXXXXX)"
curl -fL https://github.com/zhangzhimiao1994/CubeAgent/archive/refs/heads/main.tar.gz -o "$tmp/source.tar.gz"
mkdir -p "$tmp/source"
tar -xzf "$tmp/source.tar.gz" --strip-components=1 -C "$tmp/source"
cd "$tmp/source"
sudo bash install.sh --mode auto --yes
```

Do not extract the archive directly into `/root` with `--strip-components=1`; that flattens the source tree and leaves later commands in the wrong directory.

For China-region package mirrors:

```bash
sudo env AGENT_HUB_MIRROR_MODE=auto bash install.sh --mode auto --yes
```

For HTTPS with your own certificate:

```bash
sudo env AGENT_HUB_PUBLIC_URL=https://agent.example.com \
  AGENT_HUB_TLS_CERT_FILE=/root/certs/fullchain.pem \
  AGENT_HUB_TLS_KEY_FILE=/root/certs/privkey.pem \
  bash install.sh --mode auto --yes
```

After installation, the script prints a management URL ending in `/setup` and a one-time setup code. Create the first super admin there.

## Offline Docker Initial Deployment Package

If the target machine cannot reach the public internet but can run Docker, build and export the images on an online machine first. This package starts a new empty system. It does not include the current production database, users, model configuration, Hermes+ memories, attachments, or secrets.

### 1. Prepare configuration on the online build machine

```bash
cd CubeAgent
cp deploy/compose/.env.example deploy/compose/.env
```

Edit `deploy/compose/.env` and replace at least these placeholder values:

- `AGENT_HUB_MASTER_KEY`
- `AGENT_HUB_JWT_SIGNING_KEY`
- `POSTGRES_PASSWORD`
- `LITELLM_MASTER_KEY`
- `AGENT_HUB_SETUP_CODE`

You can generate random values with:

```bash
openssl rand -base64 32
openssl rand -base64 32 | tr '+/' '-_' | tr -d '='
```

`deploy/compose/litellm.yaml` starts with an empty model list:

```yaml
model_list: []
litellm_settings:
  drop_params: true
  request_timeout: 600
```

For model calls in an offline environment, configure a local model service, an internal OpenAI-compatible relay, or another reachable provider from the Web console. A disconnected machine does not automatically have external model access.

DOCX/PPTX generation itself uses deterministic standard-library OOXML builders, so the offline Docker image does not need extra public package downloads for Office file creation. A fresh offline install still needs a local, intranet, or otherwise reachable model configured before the main agent can plan and call those tools. Generated Office files are written under `generated_artifact_dir`, which defaults to `/var/lib/agent-hub/generated-artifacts` and is persisted by the `agent_hub_data` Docker volume.

### 2. Build and pull all required images

```bash
docker compose -f deploy/compose/docker-compose.yml --env-file deploy/compose/.env build
docker compose -f deploy/compose/docker-compose.yml --env-file deploy/compose/.env pull postgres redis caddy litellm
```

The offline image set must include:

- `agent-hub:latest`
- `postgres:16-alpine`
- `redis:7-alpine`
- `caddy:2-alpine`
- `ghcr.io/berriai/litellm:main-stable`

### 3. Export the images and compose configuration

```bash
docker save \
  agent-hub:latest \
  postgres:16-alpine \
  redis:7-alpine \
  caddy:2-alpine \
  ghcr.io/berriai/litellm:main-stable \
  -o mofang-agent-offline-images.tar

tar -czf mofang-agent-offline-compose.tgz \
  deploy/compose/docker-compose.yml \
  deploy/compose/Caddyfile \
  deploy/compose/healthcheck.sh \
  deploy/compose/litellm.yaml \
  deploy/compose/.env
```

`mofang-agent-offline-compose.tgz` contains `.env`; treat it as a secret file. Do not commit it to Git or send it to untrusted locations.

### 4. Import and start on the offline target machine

```bash
mkdir -p /opt/mofang-agent
cd /opt/mofang-agent

docker load -i /path/to/mofang-agent-offline-images.tar
tar -xzf /path/to/mofang-agent-offline-compose.tgz --strip-components=2

chmod 600 .env
docker compose --env-file .env up -d
docker compose --env-file .env ps
```

On first startup, the `migrate` service runs `alembic upgrade head` to create an empty database schema. The `bootstrap` service uses `AGENT_HUB_SETUP_CODE` from `.env` to prepare the first-admin setup flow. Open `AGENT_HUB_PUBLIC_URL/setup` and create the first super admin.

If you only need an offline fresh install, you do not need to export production database dumps or Docker volumes.

## First Setup

1. Sign in to the Web console.
2. Open **Models** and add at least one normal model for the main agent.
3. Open **Main Agent** and choose the model, control mode, decision policy, Hermes policy, and review limits.
4. Open **System Settings** and enable only the system features you need: multimedia generation and OpenClaw. Project-level Vibe Coding is not exposed in the current UI; its backend metadata field is retained for a future harness/runtime integration.
5. Configure optional modules: Skills, MCP, channels, multimedia models, schedules, memories, and users.

## Models

Models are split into two categories.

**Normal Models** are used for chat, reasoning, tool calling, structured output, coding, and multimodal understanding when the deployment is marked with the relevant capability. Providers include OpenAI, DeepSeek, Anthropic, Kimi/Moonshot, Qwen/DashScope, Qwen Token Plan, MiniMax, OpenAI-compatible relays, and Anthropic-message relays.

**Multimedia AI** is used for generation jobs, not ordinary chat. Presets include Sora, OpenAI Audio, MiniMax Hailuo, MiniMax Audio, Google Veo, Kling, Alibaba Wan, Seedance, Seedream, and relay/custom providers. Capability tags such as `image_generation`, `video_generation`, and `audio_generation` control routing. A video request is rejected before submission if the selected deployment is not recognized as a video-capable model.

MiniMax/Hailuo video generation is implemented by the current multimedia executor. Other preset providers are stored and routed by capability, and can be extended by adding provider clients behind the common multimedia provider interface.

Office file generation is a runtime tool capability, not a `ModelCapability` value. Keep models marked with ordinary capabilities such as `text`, `tool_calling`, and `structured_output`; document and presentation tasks should route to writing or design roles that can call:

- `document.generate_docx`: creates a real DOCX artifact from a structured document blueprint.
- `presentation.generate_pptx`: creates a real PPTX artifact from a structured slide blueprint.

Built-in PPTX templates are `consulting-clean`, `technical-blueprint`, and `dark-launch`. Generated files include file metadata and an authenticated `download_url`; the Web console renders them as file cards in run details, conversation output, and child-agent work seats.

## Chat And Modes

The first screen is the actual work surface. Use the left navigation drawer for modules and the right conversation drawer for historical chats. Conversation names use the first user request plus a timestamp, so repeated topics stay distinguishable.

The chat page supports:

- `auto`: main agent decides the execution mode.
- `direct`: use one selected model directly.
- `dispatch`: route work to configured agents.
- `discuss`: run a discussion-style workflow.
- `hybrid`: combine dispatch and discussion.

Historical conversations expose a branch action for continuing with prior context; once a branch reference is active, the composer shows an explicit cancel control instead of requiring a per-message Handoff toggle. Project-level Vibe Coding (generate a project, read/write code, run tests, review, debug, and verify again) is reserved for a future harness/runtime integration: the current UI does not expose a Vibe Coding button, while the backend metadata field remains for future compatibility. Until that harness exists, coding-related requests are treated as advisory work: the agent may inspect supplied code context, explain issues, draft implementation plans, and produce patch-style suggestions or file artifacts, but it does not directly mutate the user's source tree. A running chat can be stopped from the composer, and detected schedule proposals can be cancelled before they create durable records.

Dispatch and discussion runs render a compact process card in the conversation stream. The card opens the child-agent work-seat drawer, where each agent has its own seat with status such as working, waiting, failed, or done. The drawer favors short categorized summaries; detailed event fields, tool payloads, model metadata, and artifact metadata are hidden until the user opens the relevant card and expands full fields. This keeps long task traces readable while preserving auditability.

Long conversations are handled by the conversation framework. When the history approaches the main agent model context window, Cube Agent compacts older turns, keeps the origin goal and latest decisions, and passes the compacted context into the next run.

Hermes learning is not the same as raw chat history. A learning record first lands in the Hermes ledger with a Chinese one-line summary. Reusable Cognitive experiences are separate candidates and only affect future runs after confirmation. Runtime guidance is scoped: `用户记忆` applies only to the same user, while `根记忆` applies across users in the same tenant.

## Cognitive Learning And Governance

Cube Agent uses Hermes for conversation learning and a separate Cognitive layer for reusable experience. Runtime outcomes are assessed by the Outcome Critic, then reflected into candidate experiences or strategies only when there is enough evidence. Important records keep provenance, confidence, usage counts, success/failure counts, contradictions, scope, and version metadata.

The default learning policy is candidate-first: new experiences and strategies can be collected automatically, but they should be reviewed before becoming active runtime guidance. Reflection can update ordinary experience quality, but it cannot modify core persona/SOUL, safety policy, model permissions, or tool permissions.

The runtime does not inject all memory into the prompt. It builds a bounded working set from user-scoped confirmed memory plus confirmed root memory, then skips archived or low-quality records so long-term use should make guidance more compact rather than larger.

Schedule-like messages with a concrete time, date, or recurrence plus an executable action are detected as schedule proposals. The system shows the plan first and only creates the schedule after confirmation. Ordinary questions about schedule design or bugs stay in the conversation.

Skill creation requests should also start in chat. For example: `I want to create a research Skill for AI papers`. The main agent should collect the goal, sources, acceptance tasks, and safety boundary, then produce a reviewable Skill candidate instead of installing an unverified Skill directly.

## OpenClaw

OpenClaw is a system-level feature switch for controlled computer and server operations.

Supported operation kinds are:

- `server_command`
- `desktop_action`
- `screen_read`
- `file_read`

Permission modes are:

- `ask`: require approval before operations.
- `read_only`: allow only read-style operations.
- `auto_review`: auto-review low-risk operations and require approval for higher risk.
- `trusted_auto`: for trusted environments only.

Operations use configured command allowlists and adapter records. Local Linux server commands can run through the bundled adapter. Remote adapters can also perform bounded `file_read` operations without an argv command when `OPENCLAW_ADAPTER_ALLOWED_FILE_ROOTS_JSON` is configured with explicit absolute roots; output is capped by `OPENCLAW_ADAPTER_FILE_READ_LIMIT_BYTES`. Screen reads can be exposed through a fixed adapter-side driver command in `OPENCLAW_ADAPTER_SCREEN_READ_COMMAND_JSON`, so Cube Agent requests `screen_read` without sending arbitrary argv. Desktop actions can likewise use `OPENCLAW_ADAPTER_DESKTOP_ACTION_COMMAND_JSON`; the adapter passes the bounded operation JSON to that fixed driver over stdin. Windows, Linux desktop, macOS, screen, and filesystem targets should be connected with dedicated credentials and least privilege. Every remote adapter must expose `/v1/openclaw/health` with its platform and supported capabilities; Cube Agent checks that health response before execution so unsupported desktop, screen, or file operations are not treated as available.

Useful command:

```bash
scripts/agent-hub openclaw-adapter
```

## Skills And MCP

Skills are uploaded as archives, scanned, and approved before use. Accepted outer archive names are `.zip`, `.tar`, `.tar.gz`, and `.tgz`.

A package may contain a single Skill or multiple Skill directories. Multi-skill bundles can include extra directory layers; the scanner looks for valid skill manifests and reports skipped entries. Each individual Skill still goes through path traversal checks, size limits, file count limits, dependency pinning checks, forbidden extension checks, permission diffing, and approval.

Skill names are de-duplicated by default: the newest approved upload is the active version for that name. When an upload conflicts with an existing Skill name, the review flow asks whether to overwrite the active version or keep a separate selectable version. Use separate versions only when operators intentionally need a controlled fallback; otherwise keep the latest version to avoid duplicated routing choices.

MCP servers are configured separately with transport, command or URL, allowed tools, executable allowlists, domain allowlists, and timeouts.

## Channels

The channel layer connects external chat platforms to the main agent. The console includes configuration surfaces for Feishu, DingTalk, WeCom, WeChat, Telegram, Slack, QQ, and custom webhook entries. Feishu has first-class setup documentation and runtime integration.

Feishu supports long connection mode with App ID and App Secret. Webhook mode remains available as a fallback when you need platform-side URL verification or event encryption.

Channel messages now enter the main agent first. The channel layer does not choose Direct, Dispatch, Discussion, Hybrid, Vibe Coding, Help, OpenClaw, or schedule mode by command text; the main agent judges the entry and route from the full message. Follow-up turns in the same channel conversation continue the latest resolved mode by default. Explicit phrases such as switching to discussion mode change mode, while explicit new-topic/new-conversation phrases return to fresh main-agent routing.

When a user needs to request specific resources, place a contiguous selector block at the very beginning of the message:

- `@github`: request a plugin.
- `&research`: request a Skill.
- `#filesystem`: request an MCP server.

For example, `@github &research #filesystem Review this repository plan` attaches resource hints while preserving the original message text. `@`, `&`, and `#` appearing after normal text are treated as ordinary content, so phrases like `C#`, `#heading`, or `@someone` do not become resource calls.

Feishu replies use rich post payloads for structured run sections and markdown tables. Long plain text is split across reply bubbles, while oversized markdown tables are truncated at complete row boundaries with a notice so table formatting is not cut mid-row.

The legacy Feishu field `FEISHU_COMMAND_ALIASES` is kept only for backward-compatible configuration storage. Saved aliases are no longer active routing commands and are not shown as effective channel commands.

See [docs/feishu-setup.md](docs/feishu-setup.md).

## Logs, Audit, And Hermes+

The Logs center separates audit logs, model errors, mode errors, feature errors, agent errors, and channel errors. Each log table supports search, column filters, sorting, selection, and JSON export.

Audit records cover administrative changes and user-triggered conversation submissions. For `run.submit`, the audit details include:

- `user_id` and `user_role`
- `run_id`
- `conversation_id` and `reference_conversation_id`
- requested mode and accepted mode
- workflow, selected agents, direct model, the backend-compatible Vibe Coding metadata flag, and attachment count
- message preview and `message_sha256`

Hermes+ stores learning records separately from chat. Conversation memory, scheduler observations, and reusable experience candidates are separated so runtime telemetry does not pollute user-facing conversation memory. Experience candidates must be confirmed before they can be injected into future runs. Confirmed experiences are retrieved through the existing Hermes runtime advice path as short, bounded guidance instead of dumping the whole memory ledger into context.

## Operations

Common commands after native installation:

```bash
scripts/agent-hub status
scripts/agent-hub logs
scripts/agent-hub doctor
scripts/agent-hub backup /tmp/agent-hub-backup.tar.gz
scripts/agent-hub backup verify /tmp/agent-hub-backup.tar.gz
scripts/agent-hub restore /tmp/agent-hub-backup.tar.gz
scripts/agent-hub upgrade
```

See [docs/operations.md](docs/operations.md) and [docs/installation.md](docs/installation.md).

## Security Notes

- The installer does not modify cloud security groups. Open public ports deliberately in your cloud console.
- API keys and secrets are stored as secret references and must not be submitted through chat.
- OpenClaw, Skills, MCP, and tool execution are governed by explicit capabilities, allowlists, approval records, and audit logs.
- Logs and audit details are designed to avoid leaking raw secrets.

See [docs/security.md](docs/security.md).
